# Fractalis
This software lets you visualize fractals such as Julia or Mandelbrot.

## How to build it
Run the GenerateProject.bat file to build the Visual Studio solution (only available on Windows for now).
This software uses Premake to build a Visual Studio solution.
Note: You need to have the VulkanSDK installed to run the application in Debug mode.

## How to use it
Once the solution has been built, select the mode between Debug, Release or Dist and hit F5.
To navigate through fractals, use the '+' and '-' keys and the arrow keys.
